2. Open the Hardware Manager and program the FPGA with the Vivado project
3. Click "File" and then "Launch SDK" to Launch the SDK with the Neural Network Code
4. Program the FPGA from the SDK 
5. On the host system, find the COM port that the Xilinx board is connected to
  1. This can be done by checking the SDK on the COM port it is connected to
  2.
